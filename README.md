# cfd-react-components
A bare-bones React component library for frequently used components and functionality for projects at the Center for Design at Northeastern University. All componets are separated into one of three sections:
### 1. `simple`
The most basic components that, for the most part, use already existing HTML components.
### 2. `intermediate`
These are components that combine one or more `simple` component together for additional functionality
### 3. `complex`
Components having the most logic and unique functionality usually with very specific purposes. For example components that filter data.
